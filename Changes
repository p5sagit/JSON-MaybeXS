Revision history for JSON-MaybeXS

1.003004 - 2015-03-14
 - caveat added to documentation about type checking the object returned by
   new() (John SJ Anderson, RT#102733)

1.003003 - 2014-12-06
 - ensure an old Cpanel::JSON::XS is upgraded if it is too old, as it will
   always be used in preference to JSON::XS
 - avoid "JSON::XS::Boolean::* redefined" warnings caused by an old JSON::XS
   loaded at the same time as a newer Cpanel::JSON::XS

1.003002 - 2014-11-16
 - correctly fix boolean interoperability with older Cpanel::JSON::MaybeXS

1.003001 - 2014-11-13
 - fix boolean interoperability with older Cpanel::JSON::MaybeXS

1.003_000 - 2014-10-30
 - add :legacy tag to support legacy apps

1.002006 - 2014-10-22
 - add some additional test diagnostics, to help find bad version combinations
   of JSON backends

 - fix "can I haz XS?" logic precedence in Makefile.PL
 - added the ':all' export tag
 - removed dependency on Safe::Isa

   dependency

1.002002 - 2014-04-23

 - fix installation on older perls with an older ExtUtils::MakeMaker
   (RT#94964)
