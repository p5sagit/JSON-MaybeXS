 - document how to use booleans

1.002002 - 2014-04-23
 - more metadata fiddling, to remove the Cpanel::JSON::XS dependency visible
   to static analyzers (the prequisites at install time remain unchanged)

1.002001 - 2014-04-23
 - fix installation on older perls with an older ExtUtils::MakeMaker
   (RT#94964)

 - Now also supports JSON::XS, when available: Cpanel::JSON::XS will only be
   installed when there is no XS backend already installed; Cpanel::JSON::XS
   will be used over JSON::XS when both are installed.

1.001000 - 2013-12-11
